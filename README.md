# Apply Secret Sharing to Enhancing Cloud Privacy

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how secret sharing algorithms—specifically **Blakley Secret Sharing**—can be applied to enhance data privacy and security in cloud environments. It includes sample Python code and supportive documentation.

## 📁 Included Files
- `appv5 (1).py`
  Python script implementing or simulating secret sharing logic.
  
- `blakely secret sharing.zip`  
  A zipped folder containing the main source code or additional modules related to the Blakley Secret Sharing algorithm.

- `emp details.txt`  
  Sample data file (likely containing employee details) used for testing or demonstration.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Basic Python libraries (e.g., `math`, `random`, `os`)  
  (Update this if your script uses any external libraries like `numpy`, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Unzip the file `blakely secret sharing.zip`.
2. Ensure `appv5 (1).py` and any dependencies are in the same folder.
3. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python "appv5 (1).py"
